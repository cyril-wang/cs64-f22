1. This MIPS code first stores the values that it needs to preserve on the stack, then prints the current depth value for the current call of disaggregate (starting at 2 and then decrementing by 1 each time the array is split). It then prints each element of the current array passed into disaggregate and calculates the sum + average from those, then checks whether the array can be split again (if depth == 0 or length == 1). Then, it separates the array into an array whose elements are smaller than average and one whose elements are larger than average (done by storing the elements in buffer, allocating 40 bytes for each). Finally, we call disaggregate on the small and larger arrays and pass in their respective parameters, so it does the same and splits the small array until it reaches the end condition, then does the same for the large array. When an array reaches the end condition, it deallocates its parameters from the stack, then jumps back to the location where it was called.

2. The values that we store into the stack are single values like addresses, length of arrays, n, etc..., which do not change based on array length, array values, or n value. Thus, the space used on the stack is only changed by the number of recursive calls to disaggregate (although it will be deallocated by the end). Changing depth / N value will change space used on the stack, for if we look at our example, if depth value were larger, then we could have split our sub-arrays even further and had more recursive calls, leading to more space on the stack used. Array values would also possibly affect it, for there are edges cases where some recursive calls are not triggered. For instance, if there were one small number and the rest were the same larger number, when the array is split, the smaller array would only contain the single small number and thus would satisfy the end condition and not continue on its recursion. Or if the array were more evenly "spread out", then the array would likely have more recursive calls as the array will likely continuing splitting until it reaches max depth. Finally, array length would also affect it, for smaller arrays have less to split, meaning that it likely hits the end condition earlier/easier and stops its recursive calls before reaching max depth, or for large ones, would have more recursive calls as it would only stop after reaching max depth since it would be less likely to reach array size of 1.
